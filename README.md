This is a generic, easy to use, and keras-compatible deep RL framework.

It began as a fork of [keras-rl](https://github.com/matthiasplappert/keras-rl) but is now a separated project.

# Features

* Define your Deep Nets using Keras
* Easy to add a new algorithm using a well-defined API
* Advanced training capabilities: Offline traning, critic-only (or actor-only) training...
* Easy logging : Tensorboard, Terminal...

# Installation
Run :
```
pip install  git+ssh://git@github.com/Phylliade/vinci.git
```
