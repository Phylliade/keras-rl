    A processor acts as a coupling mechanism between an `Agent` and its `Env`. This can

    you can effectively translate between the two without having to change the underlaying
    implementation of the agent or environment.

    Do not use this abstract base class directly but instead use one of the concrete implementations

    In some cases, you have environments that return multiple different observations per timestep

    be used to report the angles for each joint). Usually, this can be handled by a policy that has
    multiple inputs, one for each modality. However, observations are returned by the environment
    in the form of a tuple `[(modality1_t, modality2_t, ..., modalityn_t) for t in T]` but the neural network
    expects them in per-modality batches like so: `[[modality1_1, ..., modality1_T], ..., [[modalityn_1, ..., modalityn_T]]`.
    This processor converts observations appropriate for this use case.
